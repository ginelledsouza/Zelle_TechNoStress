# Zelle - Tech No Stress

# About Project
The market is flooded with products. These products are offered by big companies such as Apple, Samsung, OPPO, Vivo, OnePlus, Dell, HP, 
etc. Due to the increasing competition these companies tend to launch many products yearly. This results in the end user being 
overwhelmed in an ocean of technologies. Z’elle provides assistance to such users so that they are able to find the most suitable gadget.  

# Objective
Z’elle makes exploring easier through machine learning algorithms and self made recommendation systems. The main objective of 
this project is to provide assistance to electronic buyer. It truly proves to be a one stop solution that allows the user to choose 
a desired product from a wide variety of mobile phones, tablet phones and personal laptops. Z’elle brings a range of optimal technologies 
that have been purchased, used, and loved by many.   

# Project Features

1. **Content Based Recommendation**<br>
When the requested features are unavailable, recommendations are made based on the similar features that have been requested by the user. 
These results are then filtered by ratings and stars given by millions, thus offering the best technology to our end users

2. **Algorithm Based Recommendation**<br>
Many times users are unaware of what technology would be the best for them. In such cases the website provides a set of questionnaire. 
Based on the usage details given by the users, Z’elle AI predicts the best technologies. 

3. **Trending Technical News**<br>
Users can follow the latest technological trends through the “Tech News” webpage. Headlines and full articles for the current and the 
most latest technical trends can be found on the same webpage
	
4. **Data Records**<br>
This project consists of two forms – AI Prediction form and Feedback form. The data collected by these forms are saved into our 
database (PostgreSQL),which can be a huge help to perform in depth future analysis

5. **Z’elle Analytics**<br>
The data recorded by through the feedback and gadget prediction forms are recorded. This information is used for analytics that can be 
offered as a service to our clients. For analytics  "Google Data Studio" has been implemented.
